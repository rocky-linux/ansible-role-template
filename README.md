# Ansible template role
Role that fulfills some need and there was not some sort of equivalent elsewhere.

## Getting started

1. Get the development repository: `git clone repo`
2. Install pre-commit: `pre-commit install`
3. Make edits as required as well as following the customization section
4. Run `pre-commit` to ensure we're good
5. Do your necessary development work for this role
6. Run `pre-commit` again to ensure you're good to go.
7. Optional: `molecule converge`
